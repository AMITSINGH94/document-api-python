Tableau SDK for Python. Currently this contains only the Document API. This will evolve. Help us by submitting feedback, issues, and pull requests!

Document API
---------------
This is the supported way to programmatically change Tableau files such as .twb and .tds. If you've been doing "XML hacking" this is for you too :)

Check out the examples to see how to use it.

Currently only the following operations are supported:

* Modify database server
* Modify database name
* Modify database user
